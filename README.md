# [L4D2] Unsilent-Smoker
* Whenever you encounter the AI smoker and it's preparing to attack, it emits the
*	distnguishable 'warning' sound.
*
*	However you may have seen situations where one performs the attack without
*	making the noise at all (or it gets almost insta interrupted/silenced).
*
*	It happens when the smoker isn't facing you directly before performing the attack, and 
*	his 'warning' sound gets interrupted by the 'spot prey' sound.
*	
*	This plugin simply blocks the 'spot prey' sound if the previous smoker's sound was
*	the 'warning' one.
